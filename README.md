# MERN Stack Application - Book search engine

## Description

We were tasked with transforming existing code for a Book Search Engine- changing it to a GraphQL API from a RESTful API.
I have attempted to do this but his a roadblock. I can get the application to open successfully by running npm install and npm run start from the Develop folder, however, it keeps exiting the Render deployment with errors related to bcrypt.


## Installation

Run npm run build to build the React application. Then from the package.json in the Develop directory, run npm install followed by npm run start.

## Usage

Render link:
